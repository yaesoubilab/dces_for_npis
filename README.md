# Acceptability of non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent the risk of COVID-19 infection in the United States

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the results presented 
in the paper "Acceptability of non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent 
the risk of COVID-19 infection in the United States".

The script [analysis_script.ipynb](dce_analysis/analysis_script.ipynb) contains the main analysis script
to estimate the coefficients of the discrete choice model and to perform the necessary statistical analysis.
The code is implemented in Python and uses the Biogeme package for estimating discrete choice models.

The folder [figs_and_post_analyses](figs_and_post_analyses/) contains the Python scripts
to generate the figures presented in the paper.
